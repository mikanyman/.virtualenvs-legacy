On Linux/UNIX, you can use the patch command for this.

It works in the following way:

cd /usr/lib.../site-packages/django/
patch --dry-run -p1 < ~/downloads/somefix.patch

The patch command looks in the file to find the proper files it needs to update.
The -p1 tells patch to ignore the first level of the folder mentioned in the patch file.
Often this is the project name itself.
The --dry-run option prevents actual execution, so you can experiment with it.
When everything is allright, you can remove the --dry-run option, and the actual patch will be applied.

sudo patch -R ~/.virtualenvs/rdademo/lib/python2.6/site-packages/patches/wrap_help_text_in_css_class-with_tests-r11855.diff
